## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"]((https://github.com/aedenj/kotlin-qulaity-plugin/security/advisories/new)) tab. 

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to 
your report, I'll keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask 
for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining that project following their security
reporting guidance.
